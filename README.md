### Welcome my GithubðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm Marcos Mota, I'm fascinated by working with data because it's amazing how artificial intelligence can change people's lives.

This inspired me to create a blog called [Deep Miner](https://deepminer.com.br/), a place where I publish content that can help people who are looking to learn more about arithmetic intelligence, visual computing, and NLP.

I hope that the projects hosted on my Github can be useful to you.
